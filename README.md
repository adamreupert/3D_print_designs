# 3D-print models


## Description
This is a collection of model STLs that I created to 3D print at home. 
The models were created using the [Blender software](https://www.blender.org/) and therefore not always perfect.

## Visuals
Examples of models and prints:

![alt text](modelxy/example.stl "example stl")
<br>
![alt text](modelxy/example.stl "example stl")

## Usage
Download the models you want to print and slice them in the software of your choice. I recommend the [Prusa slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/de/page/prusaslicer_424/)
